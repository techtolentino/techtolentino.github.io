#### The opportunity
Has there ever been a time when you had a brilliant idea, but didn't have the proper place to record your ideas? Of course there has - happens all the time! In fact, how many ideas die because they never made it to the drawing board? Probably quite a few!

#### The approach

I needed something quick and easy that would allow me to jot down an idea, and store it somewhere in the cloud. I also needed it done quickly because I had a few projects that I wanted to ellaborate on at some point in the future. So, I created a way that allowed an authenticated user (currently only via Twitter) to put your project ideas in the sky. Never let a project idea float away again... ever.

#### What I learned

- Ember and Ember CLI (first time using both)
- A little bit of Twitter API via it's authentication
