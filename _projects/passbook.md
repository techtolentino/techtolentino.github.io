#### The opportunity
Back when Angular first began to really take off, I remember wanting to learn it, thinking that _this was the future!_ The whole two-way data binding was such an awesome feature that I just _had_ to find some sorta use case for it.

Around the same time, I decided to take a more hands-on role in my family's finances. While running through some Angular course one night, I felt like there was an opportunity combine my newfound responsibilities with the latest framework I was learning. ðŸŽ‰ (#winning)

#### The approach
So after deciding to be a little more pro-active with our family expenses, I was totally side-tracked and began learning Angular.

Then, I had an idea - why not make a personal bill tracker prototype? Sure, tons of them exist already!, but, what better way to learn new tech, than to combine that with filling a personal need?

#### What I learned
- Angular! (version 1)
- Implementing AngularFire (Angular x Firebase)
- I learned that this app had pretty horrible UX
