#### The opportunity
When I first began learning to code, I found myself clinging onto this hip hop culture from my past. In my mind, there was this old world (hip hop) vs this new world (code), and I couldn't find a balance between the two. At that time, hip hop and software development didn't have a visible intersection. 

To me that wasn't so much of a problem as it was an opportunity. So, I created this dev-swag generator which gave the user to choose from various dev-related terms, and combine them onto a more street-like look.

#### The approach
For this, I wanted to mimic a lot of the street apparel that was out at the time, meaning oversized full shirt prints with hype colors. Additionally, the goal was to let the user choose various values as inputs, then the app would _produce_ something code related, but street friendly.

#### What I learned
- Routing via Rails
- How to use Foundation (version 5 at the time)
- I used Rails for no reason
- layering divs with z-index is a quick way to run into complications
- trying to make this sorta app _responsive_ was a pain
