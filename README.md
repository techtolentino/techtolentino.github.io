#### Introduction
It's 2016 - things had change.
And it's probably not over.

In the beginning, it was all about _proving yourself_ worthy as a developer by getting a _portfolio_ up on the web.

However, over the past couple of years, I've learned to appreciate is the intent behind the decision, the _process_ behind the project, the failures behind each success story.

With that said, the purpose of my site has pivoted. It'll no longer be project-first, but instead, I'm taking a thoughts-first approach.

Here, I hope to share the many stories of triumph and downfall that I experience as an established developer with a beginner's mindset.
