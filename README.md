###PURPOSE
 
#### Living the Dream

When I was first exposed to the world of coding, I was 7. I attempted to code BASIC 'Guessing Game' type of programs using my parents' Commodore 64 (years ago). All my life I had dreams of working in the tech-industry, only I never fully strategized a way to truly give myself that opportunity.  
  
#### Enter MakerSquare
  
Getting accepted into [MakerSquare's](http://www.makersquare.com) Full-Time Immersive Program has been life-changing. All of a sudden, I was placed in a ultra-fast-paced environment with some of the most intelligent and dedicated people I have ever met. In addition, I had the opportunity to learn from an amazing team of instructors and staff.
  
#### Representation  
  
This body of work represents a selection of projects where the experimentation of UI principals became my primary focus. With a career goal of becoming an UI Developer, I set out to explore various JavaScript libraries and plugins, CSS frameworks, color-schemes, and responsive web design practices.

###WHAT'S NEXT
  
In the upcoming months, I plan on expanding my knowledge and practice in the following:
  
* JavaScript - my main goal is to crush JavaScript
* SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics are just cool as hell... can't wait to learn this!
* D3 and Famo.us - both look very fun and very interesting
* Node // Angular // Ember... yes, in that particular order
* Deeper implementations of using Ruby on Rails
* Data-Structure Modeling
* Problem-solving and algorithms
