<p>Instead of leaving a site up that is strictly portfolio-based and (for the most part) self-centric, I'm taking this dot-com down, for now.</p>

<p>Reason being, I am requiring of myself, the appropriate capacity to go and figure out how to best understand, capture, and then demonstrate <strong>something more meaningful </strong>than an 'about me' page, or projects that I've done, or my professional work history.</p>

<p>At least once a year, mostly twice, I go through these recurring phases where I feel an urge to <strong>do more</strong> for the people in the world. It's this often-recurring and strong inner-calling.</p>

<p>Normally, I share it with my wife, we explore what it might mean, and then I puzzle over it until <strong>that feel</strong> eventually fades from my grasp.</p>

<p>It feels like, in hindsight, opportunities lost - not for me, for <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>So, this time, <em>with intent</em>, I am going to try and figure it out. I am curious to see what <strong>this thing</strong> actually might be! And I want to see, if anything, there's a something to be discovered or uncovered within these encounters.</p>

<p>Updates on the horizon, fingers crossed.</p>
