                    <h4>Failure initiates the journey</h4>
                    <img src="img/rangod.jpg" alt="Rangod" class="profile-photo">
                    <p>In December of 2013, I remember failing an interview for an ed-tech position in Oregon.</p>
                    <p>The interviewer told me that one of their teachers wanted to make the 'switch from using Dreamweaver to writing her own CSS'. Then, he asked for my recommendation.</p>
                    <quote>"I apologize, I have no idea", I replied.</quote>
                    <p>My heart sunk in that moment, realizing that I had just dropped the chances of switching my career path and improving my family's situation.</p>
                    <p>That specific failure (having no idea what CSS was), led me down an interesting path, filled with curiosity and opportunity. As a result, my wife and I packed my family up and moved from San Diego to Austin, where I would learn to code and find an entirely new career.</p>
                    <p>Since that decision, our lives have changed for the best. As a family, we sacrificed the comforts of being close to our loved ones and all that was familiar, just to 'make it' here in Austin.</p>
                    <p>Less than a year and a half after that failed interview, I am more than grateful to announce that I am a <span class="accent">Software Developer at IBM</span>. I believe that we are very, very fortunate. And, I have strong faith that my personal momentum has still yet to peak.</p>
                    <p>God is dope.</p>

                    <p>The problem?, hip hop and development didn't have a visible intersection. Yes, to me that was a huge problem. So, I created this dev-swag generator which gave the user to choose from various dev-related terms, and combine them onto a more street-like look.</p>

                    <p>So after deciding to be a little more pro-active with our family expenses, I was totally side-tracked and began learning Angular.</p>
                    <p>Then, I had a brilliant idea - why not make a personal bill tracker <em>prototype</em>? Sure, tons of them exist already!, but, what better way to learn new tech, than to combine that with filling  a personal need?</p>
