				<p>After graduating from the three month initial bootcamp here at IBM Design Studios, I was <em>deployed</em> to the CIO Organization. Here, Iâ€™d join a team of full-stack devs, all with engineering backgrounds, who were very talented and had world-class experience in building software applications - it was intimidating to say the least.</p>

<p>On my first official day, I sat in on a scrum call and heard each dev team member give their updated status. Shit was crazy. I honest-to-God had no idea what they were talking about, not only from project-specific standpoint, but even from a technical standpoint as well. I knew two things after that call:</p>

<p>I was either going to learn a ton of shit while being on this team <em>or</em> I was going to fail miserably.</p>

<p>Turns out, both are true, every dang day. Yes, I fail every day and I learn a ton from those failures.</p>

<p>Last week, I had a great conversation with our Senior Lead Engineer. After being asked to provide some feedback on how to improve our current sprintâ€™s workflow, I wrote and Slackâ€™d over a pretty decent reflection on why I felt I had failed to meet delivery deadlines (for almost 3 consecutive sprints ðŸ˜“).</p>

<p>When he came back from lunch, he suggested that we hop on the phone. The biggest takeaway from the conversation was this idea of him (and another Engineer/Manager) sending me on a <strong>Vision Quest</strong>.</p>

<p>In some cultures, more specifically tribes, the elder members of the community will send the younger members on a vision quest. These young members (in my case, a newer developer) is sent out into the wilderness for days, with nothing on their backs, in hopes of learning something valuable.</p>

<p>Often times, on a vision quest, one will experience a reconnection with nature, the strengthening of instincts, and test after test as he tries to survive the elements.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a rite of passage, and the ultimate goal is to return to your tribe with enough strength, instinct, and knowledge that you can contribute back to the community.</p>

<hr class="divider-magenta-full" />

<p>In my case, the vision quest meant a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When debugging code or trying to understand a problem, I have to dig into the deeper (even deepest) resources to find a clue. And then just when I think Iâ€™ve searched the world for a solution, to keep on searching.</li>
  <li>I have to <em>build instincts</em>, so that Iâ€™ll be able to know that even though a large block of code works, my gut should tell me if it feels right or wrong.</li>
  <li>I have to learn to become completely comfortable with difficult situations, and although I know someone on my team has the answer, I have to remember that <em>while out in the desert, there is no one to hand you an answer.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Such a poetic challenge. And itâ€™s totally one that I am up for! I canâ€™t say enough about how fortunate I am to be on a team where people invest the time, thinking, and strategies into making me a better developer in the long run.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s always been my goal to be in a place where I can contribute, and I have been there, many times in my career. But, with this approach, Iâ€™ll be able to uncover new forms of contribution along the journey.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful methodology. At any rate, back to the desert.</p>
