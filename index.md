Instead of leaving a site up that is strictly portfolio-based and (for the most part) self-centric, I'm taking this dot-com down, for now.

Reason being, I am requiring of myself, the appropriate capacity to go and figure out how to best understand, capture, and then demonstrate **something more meaningful** than an 'about me' page, or projects that I've done, or my professional work history.

At least once a year, mostly twice, I go through these recurring phases where I feel an urge to **do more** for the people in the world. It's this often-recurring and strong inner-calling.

Normally, I share it with my wife, we explore what it might mean, and then I puzzle over it until **that feel** eventually fades from my grasp.

It feels like, in hindsight, opportunities lost - not for me, for _them_.

So, this time, _with intent_, I am going to try and figure it out. I am curious to see what **this thing** actually might be! And I want to see, if anything, there's a something to be discovered or uncovered within these encounters.

Updates on the horizon, fingers crossed.
