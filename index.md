description: |
  This story was never my own, although years back I used to think so. As a husband and as a father, I've come to realize that this entire _thing_ has a deeper and more complex purpose.

  This collection of writing is meant to capture the personal growth, gained understanding, and the experiences of who I am, but further, aims to pass these ideas through the lens and context of being a part of my family.
