Hey ðŸ‘‹.

My name is Randy. I'm a husband and father, currently enjoying a simple life experience with my family in Austin, TX. (Never thought I'd be living in Texas). We're originally from San Diego, but moved here a few years back when I decided to change careers.

I write code for a living as a Senior Web Developer, focusing on mostly front-end technologies. I'm absolutely fascinated by the web, software, and design, mainly because each discipline involves problem-solving and making things.

In my spare time, I like to mess around on the piano, engage in wood-working projects, and going on family-dates with my wife and the boys. I also enjoy writing &mdash; this has been something I've been passionate about since I was young.

This particular platform is intended to capture, document, and surface my ideas, failures, and experiences, so that perhaps someone will learn something from it.

My truest/secret hope is that I can maintain this blog long enough for my sons to look back on, one day, when they're mature enough to understand what it all means, but one can only hope.

Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your day.
