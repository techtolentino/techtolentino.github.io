Hey hey ðŸ‘‹.

My name is Randy. I'm a husband and father, currently enjoying a simple life experience with my family in Austin, TX. (Never thought I'd be living in Texas). We're originally from San Diego, but moved here a few years back when I decided to change careers.

I write code for a living as a Senior Web Developer, focusing on mostly front-end technologies. I'm absolutely fascinated by web, software, and design, mainly because each discipline involves a ton of problem-solving and making things.

Speaking of that, in my spare time, I like to engage in wood-working projects here in our garage. Three months ago, I knew zero things about working with tools, but with a lot of Googling, Youtubing, and error, I've managed to build a few things from scratch.

Aside from family, code, and woodwork, I also enjoy writing -- this has been something I've been passionate about since I was a child. This would explain things like my former hip-hop career and the creation of this blog.

This particular platform is intended to capture, document, and surface my ideas, failures, and experiences, so that perhaps someone will learn something from it.

(My truest/secret hope is that I can maintain this blog long enough for our boys to look back on, one day, when they're mature enough to understand what it all means).

We'll see.
