It's been a hectic week.

Adjusting to the new space in the studio
All backend work
Manager visiting
Welcoming the newest member of our squad

Under the impression that _someone_ would be helping him, that the entire situation was already planned and handled.

Guaging how much help he's had

Gave him my contact info
Offering rides

630am pickups
Drop offs
