#### Establishing a baseline

In software development, code reviews are a well known and widespread practice for many teams. The idea is fairly simple, actually: every time a team member is adding code to the code base, _at least_ one other developer (or designer!) should review the proposed work, before it gets merged into production.

Easy.

While I don’t want to expatiate on the usefulness of the peer review practice itself, here are some quick toss-outs of what I have personally found to be beneficial — code reviews:

- lend the opportunity to learn, teach, and collaborate
- reduce the amount of bugs that get shipped into production
- strengthen team resilience through distributed knowledge and understanding
- provide a visible stream of the communication that has taken place regarding any proposed change

This list can go on for at least five to ten more items. Additionally, I’m not sure that I, nor anyone, can argue that it’s not a valuable habit for any team to adopt. Still, I’m not writing this to preach the obvious, but instead, I wanted to shift my focus over to the attitudes within the code review culture.

#### How we do

When I first joined my team, I was advised to refrain from submitting a pull request until I was absolutely certain that it was bulletproof and error free. Although this mindset doesn’t allow for early visibility into my problem-solving process, it did train me to refine and refactor my work until I felt a certain level of confidence, then submitting it.

I still think this is an acceptable attitude.

On the other side of the token, when reviewing someone else’s code, I was also encouraged _to assume that the author of the code messed up somewhere_, and subsequently, it was my job as the code reviewer to find those mistakes and expose them.

In my mind, this brings up an interesting duality when looking at the team as a whole. We all submit code that we think is undeniably worthy, but, we also look at our code like there’s something wrong with it.

#### Communicating through comments

Prior to becoming a software developer, I had spent over 15 years working in education. My experience in various learning environments span all levels; I’ve taught, mentored, and worked with thousands of students ranging from pre-K all the way up to college students. Long story short — I know, from experience, what fosters a healthy learning community.

During code reviews, one area that is especially important is the way in which team members communicate any form of constructive critique. The choice of words, when questioning one’s approach or decisions, is just as critical as the naming of functions or variables, for example.

Naturally, some people will be better word selection than others.
