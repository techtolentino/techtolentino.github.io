Recently, I've been involved with helping out with a couple of open source (OS) projects.

The first one being the <a class="link--base" href="http://open-austin.org" target="blank">Open Austin</a> civic hacking group, where I helped my friend Mateo (who also happens to be the Director!) with a very fun set of website issues.

The other being <a class="link--base" href="https://freecodecamp.com" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a>, which is a pretty awesome online *code camp* that is used by tens of thousands of people around the world.

The cool thing about Free Code Camp (FCC), is that they have such an active, international community. If a student in the US had an issue with some code challenge, say at 3:00 AM, you can bet that there's another student online who is willing to help. This happens all throughout the day, and by just watching the FCC Gitter channel, I'd estimate that the turnaround times for help ranges from 3-5 mins.

Yeah! It's pretty dope.

With my schedule of waking up at 3:30 - 4:00 AM, I've been able to hop onto Gitter and catch a bunch of aspiring developers who are suuuper new to the game. Their experience ranges from knowing how to target selectors with CSS, to trying to figure how to create their own portfolio.

On one particular morning, I was helping a couple of students in the Gitter channel, and one student asked for help. I gave some clues, lent some hints, but things were *still not working* (welcome to the world of code). So I told the dude to hit me up via DM.

After helping him solve his way through the FCC Challenge that he was stuck on, we chopped it up a bit. He asked about my background as a dev so I told the cliche stories that lead up to my current situation. Then he asked me if I'd be willing to mentor him.

_<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Oh for sure...<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_ - I told him.

For quite some time now, I've been trying to imagine a way to reciprocate the amazing experience that I've had, as an up and coming developer. More specifically, it's important to understand that within the dev community, we welcome, embrace, and exercise mentorship all the time. For me, I can name a ton of names off the top of my head, listing all the important figures that have helped grow as a developer.

Now, I have that opportunity and it's truly a blessing. I know what it's like to know absolutely nothing (shit, some days I still feel that way). I know how it is to look at some code and think, *none of this makes sense!* I remember how it feels to be so brand new to the field. And for all these reasons, I feel like I can truly have an impact on the dude who asked me to be his mentor.

Still, I'm learning now, that the honor of being someone's mentor doesn't come without some interesting responsibilities. Here are some of the things I've been thinking about as I venture off into this new role:

- Regular check-ins: this has to happen in order for the mentoring to be successful
- Thinking *big picture*: some of my best mentors cared about more than just code/career-based skills. They wanted to know that my entire situation (family, code, health) was right
- Grind: there's no shortcut around it
- Guidance and moral support: I know from first-hand experience, that learning code and working in this field can be mentally draining. This is something we both have to be mindful about.

My goal, as a mentor, is to be open, to be available, and to guide.

Time to give back.
