Three years ago, little Paxon was born in San Diego at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital - THE best hospital for women and newborns. It was sometime in the morning, I would say in the 7 o'clock hour, and the rough estimation is due to the fact that I could not be there. I was at home watching over Evan while Khris (and her best friend, Mikey), were at Sharp.

For the past three years, it has been truly a blessing for Pax to be in our lives. My wife put it best in this year's birthday card by saying

<span class="quote">Thank you for completing our family...</span>

An inside joke that we have in our family, is that Paxon is such a *Daddy's boy*. I guess that stems from several reasons. For one, he looks a lot like me when I was his age. He also loves to follow me around the house, no matter what I do. Whether I'm ironing my shirts, doing dishes, or standing at the counter finishing a git push - Paxon's at my side.

Not to mention, every time we step outside of the house, little dude loves rockin a nice fresh hat. That is *very* me.

And although there's a very strong connection or resemblance between me and Pax, I would argue that I'm not the only one privy to having a special relationship with him.

*The truth is, he's close to all of us.*

Paxon has given Evan his first true and only best friend. He makes Ev crack up with his odd-at-times behaviors and supports Evan's make believe activities every day. He protects his brother, he checks on him when he's sad or in trouble. He's everything we wanted for Evan when we decided to try for another baby.

In my observations, for my wife, Pax has introduced moments of peace, a specific sweetness, and light-heartedness into our home. The importance of that cannot be under-emphasized, because they are home-schooled kids and she spends all day with the two of them. The love that he gives to his mom is refreshing - it's new, it's different, and it's unmatchable. 

I took the day off from work to celebrate with the family. And even if we celebrated in simple fashion, I can comfortably say that with this being the first year where Paxon was truly cognizant of it being *his birthday*, he had a memorable and fulfilling one.

Happy Birthday, Paxon.

Always know in your heart, that we three feel so blessed to have you in our family. We thank you for the individualized, heartfelt relationship that you have built with each of us.

God Bless you my son.


Daddy
