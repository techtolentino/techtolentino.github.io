No one looks at your portfolio. Is that true? Might be. But it hasn't stopped me from wanting to redo my entire site again. For me, this is probably the fifth iteration within the past year and a half, so I thought it might be a good time to explain why I re-coded my site, again...

### Breathing room
When you spend 8-10 hours a day, pushing the edges of what you know and stretching your brain to code parts of the stack that you aren't used to, it hurts. The lack in familiarity and the rigorous problem-solving environment can definitely take its toll.

When you spend all day working with what you don't know, you gotta bring it down a few levels and revisit the familiar.


### The Experience
In my original portfolio, I was solving for pretty simple things. Essentially, a visitor would be able to:

- learn about me
- view a couple of projects
- access my GitHub account
- have a way to contact me 
  
However, once I started working as an actual developer, something that became apparent to me is that *most* of the more established devs didn't have project portfolios! What? Think about that, sure they have active GitHub accounts, they teach courses, or blog; but, not a lot of senior devs show have a portfolio of tiny side projects.

As time goes on, I'm looking forward to providing site visitors (if any) more of a glimpse into the **thoughts** behind my work, instead of just some Heroku or Ember x Firebase app - that's so two thousand and late.

### Style decisions
I was getting tired of the whole 'single page' experience - why does everything have to be on one page all the time? That UX is so played out, and overrated in my opinion. Plus, since I intended to include a blog feature on my site, the single-page/long-scroll design was no longer appropriate, I would definitely have to route to another page. So I figured, screw it - let's just have multiple pages.

### A simple build
I decided to run with Jekyll, strip it of all it's styles, and customize the heck out of it. I also wanted to use vanilla Javascript (if anything needed JS). So far we have markdown, Liquid, Sass, Javascript.
