#### Change is inevitable

It's been a hectic week.

At work, there have been a lot of moving pieces, both physically and in terms of the project. Our Austin team is adjusting to our new space within the Design Studio after the most recent floor plan rearrangement. I can't complain though; my new desk space is situated next to a window, on the 8th floor, and its expansive view overlooks north Austin, which is refreshing.

Within our product's development workflow, the entire engineering team (front and back-end) has recently adopted a full-stack model, which means that all developers/engineers work on completing a single story at a time; another way to frame the approach is, tasks are not designated according to one's stack area expertise. Front-end devs work on back-end tasks if that's the current priority, and vice versa.

From what I understand, we're one of the rare teams in the entire company that has implemented this model. And since most of our committed, recent sprint work has involved building out the infrastructure for back-end micro-services, I've been doing all back-end work for the past two sprints. Honestly, it has been very uncomfortable, but at the same time, super interesting. Still, I do feel fortunate to have this opportunity to learn new things. As a result, it has awakened my interest in new areas of code, but I do admit, it's just been difficult.

(I'm going to dedicate an entire post to this model at some point).

But lastly, and the thing I wanted to expound on, is that we've added a new software engineer to our team here in Austin. And while he has years of experience in software, there is an interesting aspect at play here - he's brand new to the States. And to me, the worst part is that there wasn't a whole lot of effort placed into the  planning for his arrival.

#### Enter visceral feelings

I'm not sure why, but to me, I was fairly disappointed and embarrassed at the idea that our team lacked some form of an on-boarding process. For one, I felt badly for the person who joined our team, and in this particular case, one who was and still is new to the country. Not only did we fail at providing a hospitable introduction, but at the same time, it felt like we could have done way better job at identifying the huge ambassadorial responsibilities of welcoming someone new to our country.

So on last Tuesday, after I had helped the interns downstairs with some user testing on a prototype, I returned back to my desk to see that our new team member had joined our space. He was situated directly across from me at our dev pod, and was working on his brand new Macbook. I said hello, then continued to proceed with my own work.

About a half-hour went by, and when I came up for air, I noticed that he wasn't interacting with anyone, at all. I figured, _maybe someone gave him something to do?, and he was working on it?_ I looked around at the other members of the team and saw that everyone was heads down, focused on work with earphones in/headphones on - a normal scene on my team.

I made a mental note of my observations, then dove back into the code.

Another half-hour passed and nothing changed - the team is working, the new guy was busy at his computer. I wondered if I had missed something, for example, maybe they already did introductions, or a tour, or already put him onto something to work on. At that point, I decided to speak up.

I began by asking questions.

_<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Is there anything you need? Do you know where to start? Did someone speak to you about what you'd be working on?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

Then he replied, _<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Do you know what's a good bank that I can look into?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

_Hmmm... ok_ - that was my external response. 

But internally, I was actually shocked. Why? Because hearing this definitely opened my eyes to where we _truly needed to start_. While one might (safely) assume that we start off by enabling him to write code or perhaps discuss the domain specifics of our project, in that moment, I realized that this guy was re-establishing his entire life situation.

This was about way more than just code, and realizing that left me with mixed feelings.

On the one side, I felt humbled and vulnerable (maybe **for** him), mostly because I can relate to this on a personal level. I've lived in many places and moved a ton of times.  So I am mindful of what it's like to be new to a city or country. I remember what it was like to relocate my family to Austin, a place where we'd have no familial connections or support network. Then on the other hand, I was considerably upset that I, myself, didn't do _anything_ to prepare for this moment.

Sure, one might argue that this is an HR responsibility, or even a wider team obligation. But for me, being member on this team, meant that I was naturally an accountable part of the equation.

After a few minutes of chatting, I learned that he needed a full-on introduction to not only our team and our product, but he also needed a quick run down of some bare essentials. He needed to know things like where to buy groceries, where to establish a bank account, what's in his community, etc. Consequently, I offered to give him a ride home that evening with the intent of pointing out some places of interest that he might want to know about.

#### Fixing the situation

When we pulled into his complex, I offered to pick him up the next morning. The only caveat was, I wake up at 4:00 AM, and begin my commute into the office at around 6:30 AM (mainly to beat traffic, but mostly to avoid Texas heat). What's interesting is that this picking up/dropping off has become a part of my commute - it became a routine for me, and I imagine it will be this way until he has an established car situation.

On more than one occasion, we'll discuss software-related topics such as things like Node, security, async Javascript, micro-services, etc. These have been fascinating conversations because there's a lot about tech that I still don't know. But, more importantly, this has also afforded us the chance to establish a friendship, exchange ideas, share stories of each other's culture, and answer questions about our team.

And while this I truly believe that this has made up for our lack of an on-boarding process, I still think the entire situation would've been _that much better_ had we planned something.

#### How to properly on-board

With all that being said, I've learned a lot about what it means to truly on-board a new team member. Additionally, this topic sparked a pretty decent discussion at our latest sprint retrospective meeting. Here are some of the takeaways that I believe are worth sharing:

- **Having a 'Day 1 starter kit'** - this can be as minimal as a document with a list of things to know and accomplish on the first day, or, it can be as awesome as an interactive todo list app
- **Creating a sponsorship system** - for the first week or two, someone on the team should volunteer to be a sponsor for the new team member, basically making sure that the new team member has all of the essentials in place
- **Providing artifacts** - the new team member should go home with some artifact(s) that they could look over. Ideas that came to mind were slide decks, repositories, seating charts, org charts, and so forth
- **The 'Meet us' challenge** - the new member joining the team can possibly book at least 5 meetings, with different individuals on the team, just to chat and get know that team member. Discussion topics can include previous experience, current work, understanding one's role in the team. (I think this provides great benefit)
- **Setting up Dev/Design environments** - one cannot be successful without the proper tools and understanding of team practices. As a team, be ready to provide your newest member with all of the necessary software/hardware 
- **Hosting an introductory lunch** - while your entire team is there to work, one of the best ways to build and enhance relationships is in a simple team lunch. This opens up the communication lines and is the perfect opportunity become more acquainted

#### Remember, people first

I find it ironic that a product team can spend so much time, invested in solving for users, and at the same time lack an on-boarding process. It doesn't make sense to me. To reiterate what I say on the landing page of this site, **good code is about the people**, it's about the team and the users we solve for. It truly is. And when it comes to on-boarding new team members, it's **not** about how quickly one can get a pull-request up and merged or how fast one can build an asset. 

At least in my opinion it isn't.

In my humble opinion, the proper on-boarding of a new team addition is about fostering a healthy team culture from the get go, and I believe it is something that every individual on the team is responsible for.

People skills before anything.
