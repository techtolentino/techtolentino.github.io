#### Change is good

It's been a hectic week.

At work, there have been a lot of moving pieces, both physically and in terms of the project. Our team is adjusting to our new space in the Design Studio after the major floor plan rearrangement. I can't complain at all though. My new desk is situated next to a window, on the 8th floor, which is pretty nice.

Within our product workflow, the entire engineering team (front and backend) have moved to a full-stack approach, and since most of our committed sprint work involves building out the infrastructure for backend microservices, it has been very uncomfortable.

And lastly, we've added a new software engineer to our team; and while he has years of experience in software, he's brand new to the States.

The worst part is, there wasn't a whole lot planned for his arrival.

#### Visceral feelings

I'm not sure why, but to me, I was hugely disappointed and embarrassed at the idea that our team lacked some form of onboarding process. For one, I felt for the person joining our team, and in this particular case, one who is new to the country. Not only did we fail at providing a hospitable and welcoming environment, but at the same time, it felt like we had huge ambassadorial responsibilities to someone who was new to our country.

After looking around at the other members on my team, seeing that everyone was heads down, focused on work with earphones in/headphones on, I decided to speak up.

I began by asking questions.

_<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Is there anything you need? Do you know where to start? Did someone speak to you about what you'd be working on?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

Then he replied, _<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Do you know what's a good bank that I can look into?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

Hearing this definitely opened my eyes about where we _needed to start_. While one might (safely) assume that we start off by enabling him to write code or maybe dive into the mission and vision of our project, in that moment, I realized that this guy was re-establishing his life, not only his work.

This left me with mixed feelings.

On the one side, I felt humbled and vulnerable (maybe for him?), mostly because I can relate. I've lived in many places and I know the feeling of being new. I know what it's like to relocate my family to a brand new city, not having any connections or familiarity. On the other hand, I was considerably upset that I didn't do _anything_ to prepare for his first day.

After a few minutes of chatting, I learned that he needed a full-on introduction to not only our team and our product, but he also needed a quick run down of some bare essentials. I offered to give him a ride home that evening so that I can point out some places of interest that he might want to know about.

#### Fixing the situation

Over the past week, I have picked him up for work (6:45 am, my schedule), and give him a ride home at the end of the day. On more than one occasion, we'll discuss software-related topics such as things like Node, async Javascript, microservices, etc. 

But, more importantly, this has not only given us the chance to establish a friendship, but it has also been a great opportunity to exchange ideas, share stories of each other's culture, and answer questions about our team.

#### How to properly onboard

With all that being said, I've learned a lot about what it means to truly onboard a new team member. Additionally, this topic sparked a pretty decent discussion at our latest sprint retrospective meeting. Here are some of the takeaways that I believe are worth sharing:

- <strong>Day 1 Starter Kit</strong> - this can be as minimal as a document with a list of things to know and accomplish on the first day, or, it can be as awesome as an interactive todo list app
- <strong>Sponsorship system</strong> - for the first week or two, someone on the team should volunteer to be a sponsor for the new team member, basically making sure that the new team member has all of the essentials in place
- <strong>Artifacts</strong> - the new team member should go home with some artifact(s) that they could look over. Ideas that came to mind were slide decks, repositories, seating charts, org charts, and so forth
- <strong>Meet us challenge</strong> - the new member joining the team can possibly book at least 5 meetings, with different individuals on the team, just to chat and get know that team member. Discussion topics can include previous experience, current work, understanding one's role in the team. (I think this provides great benefit)
- <strong>Dev / Design environments</strong> - one cannot be successful without the proper tools and understanding of team practices. As a team, be ready to provide your newest member with all of the necessary software/hardware 
- <strong>Introductory lunch</strong> - while your entire team is there to work, one of the best ways to build and enhance relationships is in a simple team lunch. This opens up the communication lines and is the perfect opportunity become more acquainted

#### People first

Like I say on my homepage of this site, good code is about the people. It truly is. And when it comes to onboarding new team members, it's <strong>not</strong> about how quickly one can get a pull-request up and merged. 

At least in my opinion it's not.

For me at least, it's about fostering a healthy team culture, and that starts in the beginning.
