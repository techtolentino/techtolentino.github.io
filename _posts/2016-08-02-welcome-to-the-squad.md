#### Change is inevitable

It's been a hectic week.

At work, there have been a lot of moving pieces, both physically and in terms of the project. Our Austin team is adjusting to our new space in the Design Studio after the major floor plan rearrangement. I can't complain at all though. My new desk space is situated next to a window, on the 8th floor, and comes with a view of north Austin, which is refreshing.

Within our product's development workflow, the entire engineering team (front and backend) have moved to a full-stack approach. We're one of the rare teams that are implementing this practice. And since most of our committed, recent sprint work has involved building out the infrastructure for backend microservices, it has been very uncomfortable. Granted, I feel like it has also awakened my interest in new areas of the tech-stack, but I do admit, it has honestly been difficult.

Lastly, we've added a new software engineer to our team here in Austin. And although he has years of experience in software, there is an interesting aspect here - he's brand new to the States.

However, the worst part is, there wasn't a whole lot that was planned for his arrival.

#### Enter visceral feelings

I'm not sure why, but to me, I was hugely disappointed and embarrassed at the idea that our team lacked some form of on-boarding process. For one, I felt badly for the person joining our team, and in this particular case, one who is new to the country. Not only did we fail at providing a hospitable introduction, but at the same time, it felt like we could have done way better job at identifying the huge ambassadorial responsibilities of welcoming someone new to our country.

So on last Tuesday, after helping the interns downstairs with some user testing, I returned back to my desk to see that our new team member had joined our space. He was sitting across from me within our pod, doing some work on his brand new Macbook. I said hello, then continued to proceed with my work.

About a half hour goes by, and when I come up for air, I notice that he's not interacting with anyone, at all. I figure, maybe someone gave him something to do? I looked around at the other members on my team and saw that everyone was heads down, focused on work with earphones in/headphones on - just a pretty normal scene on my team.

I dive back into my work.

Another half hour goes by and still the same thing - the team is working, the new guy is sitting and staring at his computer. At this point, I decided to speak up.

I began by asking questions.

_<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Is there anything you need? Do you know where to start? Did someone speak to you about what you'd be working on?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

Then he replied, _<span class="accent--cool">“</span>Do you know what's a good bank that I can look into?<span class="accent--cool">”</span>_

_Hmmm... ok_ - that was my external response. 

But internally, I was actually shocked. Why? Because hearing this definitely opened my eyes to where we _truly needed to start_. While one might (safely) assume that we start off by enabling him to write code or maybe dive into the mission and vision of our project, in that moment, I realized that this guy was re-establishing his entire life situation. This was about way more than just code.

Realizing this left me with mixed feelings.

On the one side, I felt humbled and vulnerable (maybe **for** him), mostly because I can relate to this on a personal level. I've lived in many places and moved a ton, growing up, so I am aware of what it's like being new to a city and new to a country. I remember what it was like to relocate my family to Austin, a place where we'd have no having any connections or support network. Then on the other hand, I was considerably upset that I, myself, didn't do _anything_ to prepare for his first day.

Sure, you can say that this should be an HR responsibility, or even a team obligation. But for me, being member on this team, meant that I was naturally an accountable part of the equation.

After a few minutes of chatting, I learned that he needed a full-on introduction to not only our team and our product, but he also needed a quick run down of some bare essentials. I offered to give him a ride home that evening so that I can point out some places of interest that he might want to know about.

#### Fixing the situation

Over the past week, I have picked him up for work (6:45 am, my schedule), and give him a ride home at the end of the day. On more than one occasion, we'll discuss software-related topics such as things like Node, async Javascript, microservices, etc. 

But, more importantly, this has not only given us the chance to establish a friendship, but it has also been a great opportunity to exchange ideas, share stories of each other's culture, and answer questions about our team.

#### How to properly on-board

With all that being said, I've learned a lot about what it means to truly on-board a new team member. Additionally, this topic sparked a pretty decent discussion at our latest sprint retrospective meeting. Here are some of the takeaways that I believe are worth sharing:

- **Day 1 Starter Kit** - this can be as minimal as a document with a list of things to know and accomplish on the first day, or, it can be as awesome as an interactive todo list app
- **Sponsorship system** - for the first week or two, someone on the team should volunteer to be a sponsor for the new team member, basically making sure that the new team member has all of the essentials in place
- **Artifacts** - the new team member should go home with some artifact(s) that they could look over. Ideas that came to mind were slide decks, repositories, seating charts, org charts, and so forth
- **Meet us challenge** - the new member joining the team can possibly book at least 5 meetings, with different individuals on the team, just to chat and get know that team member. Discussion topics can include previous experience, current work, understanding one's role in the team. (I think this provides great benefit)
- **Dev / Design environments** - one cannot be successful without the proper tools and understanding of team practices. As a team, be ready to provide your newest member with all of the necessary software/hardware 
- **Introductory lunch** - while your entire team is there to work, one of the best ways to build and enhance relationships is in a simple team lunch. This opens up the communication lines and is the perfect opportunity become more acquainted

#### People first

Like I say on my homepage of this site, good code is about the people. It truly is. And when it comes to on-boarding new team members, it's **not** about how quickly one can get a pull-request up and merged. 

At least in my opinion it's not.

For me at least, it's about fostering a healthy team culture, and that starts in the beginning.
