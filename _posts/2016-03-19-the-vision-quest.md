After graduating from the three month initial bootcamp here at IBM Design Studios, I was *deployed* to the CIO Organization. Here, I'd join a team of full-stack devs, all with engineering backgrounds, who were very talented and had world-class experience in building software applications - it was intimidating to say the least.

On my first official day, I sat in on a scrum call and heard each dev team member give their updated status. Shit was crazy. I honest-to-God had no idea what they were talking about, not only from project-specific standpoint, but even from a technical standpoint as well. I knew two things after that call:

I was either going to learn a ton of shit while being on this team *or* I was going to fail miserably.

Turns out, both are true, every dang day. Yes, I fail every day and I learn a ton from those failures.

Last week, I had a great conversation with our Senior Lead Engineer. After being asked to provide some feedback on how to improve our current sprint's workflow, I wrote and Slack'd over a pretty decent reflection on why I felt I had failed to meet delivery deadlines (for almost 3 consecutive sprints ðŸ˜“).

When he came back from lunch, he suggested that we hop on the phone. The biggest takeaway from the conversation was this idea of him (and another Engineer/Manager) sending me on a **Vision Quest**.

In some cultures, more specifically tribes, the elder members of the community will send the younger members on a vision quest. These young members (in my case, a newer developer) is sent out into the wilderness for days, with nothing on their backs, in hopes of learning something valuable.

Often times, on a vision quest, one will experience a reconnection with nature, the strengthening of instincts, and test after test as he tries to survive the elements.

It's a rite of passage, and the ultimate goal is to return to your tribe with enough strength, instinct, and knowledge that you can contribute back to the community.

In my case, the vision quest meant a few things: 

- When debugging code or trying to understand a problem, I have to dig into the deeper (even deepest) resources to find a clue. And then just when I think I've searched the world for a solution, to keep on searching.
- I have to *build instincts*, so that I'll be able to know that even though a large block of code works, my gut should tell me if it feels right or wrong.
- I have to learn to become completely comfortable with difficult situations, and although I know someone on my team has the answer, I have to remember that *while out in the desert, there is no one to hand you an answer.*

Such a meaningful challenge. And it's totally one that I am up for! I can't say enough about how fortunate I am to be on a team where people invest the time, thinking, and strategies into making me a better developer in the long run. 

It's always been my goal to be in a place where I can contribute, and I have been there, many times in my career. But, with this approach, I'll be able to uncover new forms of contribution along the journey.

At any rate, back to the desert.
