So, I have an idea - it's nothing new, but it will be fun, _I think_. I want to create some sorta e-book or simple app that will detail a couple of the Git workflows that I've experienced, whether that has been on a team here within IBM or in some outside, open source project. 

### Why is this important?
Because, I don't think a week goes by where someone doesn't ask for _some_ sorta Git workflow question. Sure, there are some pretty awesome Git workflow tutorials out there, but a lot of them are highly detailed and can be pretty intimidating to someone like a designer or even a less experienced developer.

In addition, I can imagine this becoming a great resource for Open Source projects. For example, I recently wrote up some <a class="link--base" href="https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="blank">Contribution Guidelines</a>, and one of the feedback items asked _'how could we adjust the doc so that it can be adopted by various projects?'_ 

To me, that only emphasizes the importance of understanding, demonstrating, and implementing a proper Git workflow. 

In my mind, this Gitflow resource might:

- help a user understand Git at the most basic level
- have tiers of complexity
- the entire Gitflow app should read like a simple ass book
- allow a user to find specific code snippets depending on where they are within a flow
- provide tiny code snippets
- maybe even generate a Contribution Guidelines doc (this'll be more of an App feature)
