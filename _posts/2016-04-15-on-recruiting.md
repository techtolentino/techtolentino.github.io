If there's one thing I should point out about my experience with joining IBM Design, it would be that the recruitment and talent acquisition team was amazing to work with. I've never experienced (or even heard of) such careful handling of prospective candidates.

Although the application process was a rigorous in terms of the list of challenges/tasks that a prospect must go through, I honestly feel like IBM Design's _recruitment practices_ are among the best in the industry.

When I was invited to help out the Talent team and take part in the process of vetting candidates, I was thrilled. Naturally, it felt like I had accomplished _something_, especially now that I was _on the other side of the interviewing table_. Also, I was honored to contribute to that same core hiring team that I highly respected (based on my entrance to IBM).

At first, my role was pretty basic - review candidate portfolios. No biggy. Every month, **hundreds** of candidates (from undergrad to industry hires) apply to IBM Design. For me, personally, it's awesome to see Front-end Developer portfolios come across my screen. Based on their portfolios, GitHub repos, and resumes, I have fun dissecting their skill-set, passion, and suitability for IBM Design.

After a while, I began to get more involved by doing on-site panel reviews, where I'd sit with a team of IBM'ers and watch a group of candidates during a certain part of the process. There, I had the chance to see them live, interacting with others, and provide quality feedback based on what I was observing.

Yet, the least-easiest part for me, out of all recruitment activities, would be the phone screen. Here, I speak to a candidate over the course of about an hour, and just get to know who they are. In addition, like pretty much every developer application process, there's some code challenge involved.

This part of the process brings me back to when I applied to IBM, about a year ago - maybe even less than that. And, the amount that _I knew_ back then was nothing in comparison to how much I've learned since. It's honestly difficult for me to sit there and judge a candidate's skills, whether they're good enough or not, and feel like they'll consequently do well or not, at IBM.

Just months ago, I knew very very basic things in HTML, CSS, and jQuery (I won't even say Javascript). I was fortunate enough to deploy to an IBM team and project that would challenge the shit out of me, allow me to fail time and again, all for the sake of personal growth and reciprocating contributions back to the team.

Who's to say that _anybody, any candidate_, cannot be as fortunate and as successful at IBM?

I, for one, can't. I whole-heartedly believe that if someone has the brains, the passion for problem-solving, humility, and the willingness to learn, that they too can flourish on any team.

As a result, there are times where I feel like I don't have the heart for recruitment. Because at the end of the day, getting hired is not about just skills - everybody knows that. It's about attitude, humility, team-playership, your personal network, and the drive to improve yourself over and over.

At the end of the day, I still hope to supply as much effort as I can towards helping out with recruitment, mainly because I still feel that our Talent team's game is on point! 

All I know is that it ain't easy.
