Earlier this year (I don't remember the exact week), I remember having a couple of very difficult days, consecutively. It must've been at least 3 days in a row.

At work, I believe I we were in the middle of removing React from our application's stack and replacing it with kefir.js - a small library for functional reactive programming. I was completely lost and honestly had no clue on how I was supposed to make any sorta significant contributions to the team.

I figured, the solution was simple - spend longer hours at work while sacrificing even more sleep than I already do, in the hopes of studying and playing catch up. During that sprint, I vividly remember waking up at times like 2:38 am or 3:00 am, then hopping online trying to figure out how that shit worked.

To make matters worse, at home, my vibe and energy was out of sync from my family's. I struggled with communicating with my babies, and my wife could tell that my mind-state was deep in code. 

On one particular evening, I remember doing dishes at our kitchen island and thinking to myself, *'why are you being more quiet than normal?'* I also recall saying to myself in that moment *'what is going on with you?...leave work at work... snap out of it!'*

Later, I was laying down in our bedroom and skimming through my Facebook feed like I habitually would. Typical shit - someone selfied, someone ate somewhere or hit the gym, someone else did some quiz, another 'friend' posted some ghost images, someone made a comment on some other racist post, and there was a new job opportunity via Austin Digital Jobs... 

That's when I realized *'damn, what am I doing?'*

Here I was, on this particular night, feeling the weight of the world weighing down on my heart as I was struggling to get along with my family, in addition to failing hard at work. And what was I doing? - wasting time, energy, and mental space, infinitely scrolling on my dumb ass Facebook feed.

In that moment, I told myself: 

*'this app, this network, this wack ass FB feed isn't helping me be a better husband, isn't helping me be a better father, and it damn sure ain't helping me learn to write reactive Javascript code!'*

My initial apprehension involved having associated apps or services where I authenticated-in/created an account using Facebook.

Then I thought - *'you know what, fuck it. If the app or service is important enough, I'll deal with it when I come across it again.'*

Later that evening, about a half hour past midnight, when my wife and boys were asleep - I took action and deleted my account. I made the decision to free up my attention and time, to reallocate my focus towards the areas that needed me more.

It has been at least 3 months without Facebook and I don't miss it one bit. I'm happy as hell to not have that wack ass *personalized* content feed in my life.
