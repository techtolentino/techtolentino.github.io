Over the weekend, my wife suggested that I listen to a woman by the name of Lisa Nichols. Lisa is a well-known inspirational speaker, she's a teacher, and just a straight up amazing human being.

In one of her talks, she tells the story of how she's always traveling and speaking at engagements across the globe.

On one particular occassion while she was on the road, her son (who was 21 years old at the time) had called her and asked if they could spend a few minutes to _'hang out'_ and talk.

"Of course!", Lisa responds... **"that food can get cold"**, she continues.

Hearing those moved worlds within me.

#### We Only Need a Moment
Oftentimes, as adults and parents, we can be so preoccupied with a nested list of things at any given moment. We store thoughts and spend our time dwelling on our careers, our interests, personal aspirations, social media, the state of the world, what needs to be done around the home, what needs fixing or cleaning, our extended family, friends, helping others... this list doesn't end.

Sometimes though, as a kid, all you need is a moment. A moment to connect with Mom or Dad, where they're not looking at a screen or holding a phone. And in that moment, maybe you want to laugh, ask a question, tell a story, or share something you've learned.

These opportunities (because that's what they really are) don't last forever.

#### Less on the Brain
One of the things I love about living in Texas is the idea that we have drastically reduced the amount of cognitive overload in our lives, mostly from the social aspect. Of course this comes at the cost of being far from the family and friends that we love and care about. However, it has provided us with the chance to slow down, see each other, and experience 'us'.

Even then, I will admit that I let my career, dreams, and personal interests get in the way. Lisa Nichols called me out on it without even knowng me personally.

**Thank you, Lisa**, for bringing this to my attention. That small story still resonates with me even days after first hearing it, and I hope it continues to remind me to prioritize my family during my own quest for personal growth and improvement.
