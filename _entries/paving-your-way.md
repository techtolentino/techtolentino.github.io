For a tech-heavy city like Austin, it seems like developer conferences are few and far between and I'm not sure why. Maybe the more complete idea has more to do with my ignorance of not knowing what events are happening around town.

There are Meetups, I guess, but with most of the start times being in the evening and also due to their locations, these haven't really been an easy option for me.

I have a family and I live further northwest than most.

But when I do discover that there are conferences in town that interest me, I try my best to make it work. Fortunately, there are two upcoming events that I will be able to attend.

#### Lead Dev Austin

Towards the end of July and early August, I learned through LinkedIn about the <a href="https://austin2018.theleaddeveloper.com/" target="blank">Lead Dev Austin</a> event happening at the end of this year. While this this conference is geared towards a more established group technical leaders, they also welcome aspiring dev leads as well.

I applied to do a talk about the undefined path that junior (and even senior) developers experience when trying to transition from a dev practitioner into more of a leadership/management role. Over the course of three days, my wife helped me brainstorm and refine my application and we thought we had arrived at the perfect pitch for a talk.

My proposal was rejected, which is fine. After all, it was the first time that I ever applied to speak.

However, one cool thing that the Lead Dev Austin event offers is a scholarship scheme. After communicating back and forth with the event organizers, I found out that I was still able to apply for that, even if my proposal wasn't accepted.

Well, a couple of days ago while stalled in traffic on my way into work, I learned that I was accepted into the scholarship track and I couldn't be more excited.

When I got to my desk, I sent a quick thank you note to the folks over at <a href="https://www.whiteoctoberevents.co.uk/" target="blank">White October Events</a> (the team responsible for throwing the event). 

#### Developer Week Austin

On that very same day, later in the evening, I received another email from the Event Coordinator for <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/Austin/" target="blank">DeveloperWeek Austin</a>. This event is touted as 'the largest developer conference and expo' in Austin.

(Two in one day, I know!)

For this one, I sent in an application to volunteer in whatever capacity I could be useful, and they gladly accepted. Along with volunteering, they grant you a Full Pro Pass, which is very generous of them.


#### Your Learning Awaits You

The biggest takeaway here, I'd say, is that you don't have to wait for your company to pay for your learning opportunities. You don't have to wait for permission. You can take it upon yourself to do the research, leverage your network, and connect with the appropriate people in order to attend some of these conferences.

So for me, that is the lesson - you have to take the initiative and seek out your own opportunities for growth.

I highly encourage anyone to find these events and conferences so that they can connect with others and learn about the latest trends in their own respective industry.

Whether you're going to volunteer or apply for a scholarship, at the end of the day, you have to remind yourself - it's okay to ask.
