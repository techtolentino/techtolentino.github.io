One of the main motivators for deciding to homeschool our boys was to give them the freedom to learn things that interested them, when they wanted. This _breathing room_ gives the child an allowance to naturally partake in continuous learning, unbound by enforced schedules or prescribed syllabi.

Having over 17 years of work experience in various academic  settings, I know firsthand what the public school system looks and feels like. While there may be a wide number of benefits that suits most families out there, it is also true that the system isn't the best fit for all individuals and learning styles.

Khris and I have been talking a lot more about traveling lately, more with the intention of exposing the boys to learning opportunities in their areas of interest. As parents, one of our biggest and most critical responsibilities belongs to the education of our sons -- how might we support, engage, and enhance these interests.

It has become a pattern, that when either of them begins to demonstrate a fascination in any particular area, we find ways to sort of _bring that to the front_. Currently, science and math seem to grab Evan's attention, along with mysteries and magic. On the other hand, Pax continues to express a natural love for language and creative arts.

At the moment, I'm in transition between companies; this gave us the perfect opportunity to plan a quick staycation to get out of town and experience something new. Like most parents with young children, our first thoughts were based on finding things the kids would want to do.

If there's one thing to appreciate about living in Central Texas, it'd have to the access to well-designed, interactive children museums. We've been to the Thinkery, we've done the Doseum in San Antonio -- both were amazing. So, as we looked around for similar facilities, we discovered the Mayborn Museum on the Baylor University campus, in Waco, TX.
