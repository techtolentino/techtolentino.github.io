#### Education as a priority
One of the main motivators for deciding to home school our boys was to give them the freedom to learn things that interested them, when they wanted. This _breathing room_ gives the child an allowance to naturally partake in continuous learning, unbound by enforced schedules or prescribed curriculum.

Having over 17 years of work experience in various academic  settings, I know firsthand what the public school system looks and feels like. While there may be a wide number of benefits that suits most families out there, it is also true that the system isn't the best fit for all individuals and learning styles.

<hr class="divider_elipses">

Khris and I have been talking a lot more about traveling lately, more with the intention of exposing the boys to learning opportunities in their areas of interest. As parents, one of our biggest and most critical responsibilities belongs to the education of our sons -- how might we support, engage, and enhance these interests.

It has become a pattern, that when either of them begins to demonstrate a fascination in any particular area, we find ways to sort of _bring that to the front_. Currently, science and math seem to grab Evan's attention, along with mysteries and magic. On the other hand, Pax continues to express a natural love for language and creative arts.


#### Texas knows what's up
At the moment, I'm in transition between companies; this gave us the perfect opportunity to plan a quick staycation to get out of town and experience something new. Like most parents with young children, our first thoughts were based on finding things the kids would want to do.

If there's one thing to appreciate about living in Central Texas, it'd have to be the access to these enormous, well-designed, interactive children museums. We've been to the Thinkery, we've done the Doseum in San Antonio -- both were amazing. So, as we looked around for similar facilities, we discovered the Mayborn Museum on the Baylor University campus, in Waco, TX.

It's an understatement to simply say that we _enjoyed_ the Mayborn Museum -- this place is incredible. What's nice is that the museum's arrangement and composition strikes the perfect balance between educational and interactive exhibits. Ev and Pax were able to take their time and peruse galleries and themed rooms that touched on a variety of subjects like history, anthropology, archeology, biology, energy, music, language arts, and technology.

Evan's favorite: the western-themed room, Pax's favorite: (I forget, I'll have to ask him again when he wakes up).

Costing less than $30 for the entire family, this experience was definitely worth the trip.

#### Rest and food, also important
After spending a couple of hours at Mayborn, it was time to check into our hotel and get something to eat. We stayed at a nice place just a few exits from Baylor University.

It's the funniest thing to see the kids walk into our room, every time. Turn on all the lights, sit on everything that you can sit on, jump on the beds, open every closet door, find the Bible, touch the phone, spin on the office chair, and so on... all within the first 5 minutes.

We ordered some food, re-hydrated, and just relaxed a little bit in the afternoon because we didn't want to be out and about in the unforgiving Texas heat, during rush hour.

Because we were situated on the third floor of the hotel, I had a good view of the freeway from our room and I was waiting to see what traffic looked like in Waco. As 4pm came around, traffic was light. Then 4:30pm, not much different. At 5pm, still no congestion, _what in the world, is there not rush hour traffic out here?_

Apparently not on this day.
