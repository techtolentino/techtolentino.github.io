##### Education as a priority
One of the main motivators for deciding to home school our boys was to give them the freedom to learn things that interested them, when they wanted. This _breathing room_ gives the child an allowance to naturally partake in continuous learning, unbound by enforced schedules or prescribed curriculum.

Having over 17 years of work experience in various academic  settings, I know firsthand what the public school system looks and feels like. While there may be a wide number of benefits that suits most families out there, it is also true that the system isn't the best fit for all individuals and learning styles.

Khris and I have been talking a lot more about traveling lately, more with the intention of exposing the boys to learning opportunities in their areas of interest. As parents, one of our biggest and most critical responsibilities belongs to the education of our sons -- how might we support, engage, and enhance these interests.

It has become a pattern, that when either of them begins to demonstrate a fascination in any particular area, we find ways to sort of _bring that to the front_. Currently, science and math seem to grab Evan's attention, along with mysteries and magic. On the other hand, Pax continues to express a natural love for language and creative arts.


#### Texas knows what's up
At the moment, I'm in transition between companies; this gave us the perfect opportunity to plan a quick staycation to get out of town and experience something new. Like most parents with young children, our first thoughts were based on finding things the kids would want to do.

If there's one thing to appreciate about living in Central Texas, it'd have to be the access to these enormous, well-designed, interactive children museums. We've been to the Thinkery, we've done the Doseum in San Antonio -- both were amazing. So, as we looked around for similar facilities, we discovered the Mayborn Museum on the Baylor University campus, in Waco, TX.

It's an understatement to simply say that we _enjoyed_ the Mayborn Museum -- this place is incredible. What's nice is that the museum's arrangement and composition strikes the perfect balance between educational and interactive exhibits. Ev and Pax were able to take their time and peruse galleries and themed rooms that touched on a variety of subjects like history, anthropology, archeology, biology, energy, music, language arts, and technology.

Evan's favorite experience: the western-themed room. Pax's favorite: being enclosed in a bubble in the water-play room.

Costing less than $30 for the entire family, this experience was definitely worth the trip.

#### Rest and food, also important
After spending a couple of hours at Mayborn, it was time to check into our hotel and get something to eat. We stayed at a nice place just a few exits from Baylor University.

It's the funniest thing to see the kids walk into our room, every time. Turn on all the lights, sit on everything that you can sit on, jump on the beds, open every closet door, find the Bible, touch the phone, spin on the office chair, and so on... all within the first 5 minutes.

We ordered some food, re-hydrated, and just relaxed a little bit in the afternoon because we didn't want to be out and about in the unforgiving Texas heat, during rush hour.

Being situated on the third floor gave us good view of the freeway from our room. I was waiting to see what traffic looked like in Waco. As 4pm came around, traffic was light. Then 4:30pm, not much different. At 5pm, still no congestion, _what in the world, is there not rush hour traffic out here?_ Apparently not on this day.

#### Khris' surprise
As the sun was close to setting, Khris announced that we were all going out for a surprise. She's known to do extra research on local attractions and things to do for the family, so I was curious to see what unfolded.

The drive was pretty short. She navigated us back into the university area and we turned into what seemed like a residential area, swung around into a gravel sort of back-lot, and parked. We arrived at a place called [Heritage Creamery](http://www.heritagecreamery.com/). She and the boys _love_ sweets so as soon as they saw the ice cream icon painted on the back-entrance exterior wall, they were ecstatic.

After a brief stop at Heritage, we hopped back in the car and headed to her next surprise -- the historic Suspension Bridge. Turns out, this bridge was critical for traders and travelers, and is an iconic symbol in the state's history.

We walked up and down the bridge, of course staying in close proximity to the boys' due to little gaps in the bridge and in its railing. After about fifteen minutes of catching fresh air, we caught the sunset, took a few more photos, then headed back to the hotel.

#### The bigger picture
This was the first of many trips that we plan on taking, with the specific intention of transforming it into educational opportunities for the boys. It's been years in the making, but finally, the boys are old enough to appreciate some of the more interesting aspects of traveling to new places.

Our trip to Waco encompassed some of the ideas that Khris and I have always wanted to instill in our children's life experiences -- learning to appreciate the history of various places, discovering local cultures, and observing its people.

At the end of the day, I'm thankful to be in a position where we can do such things. Our next adventure is a little over a month away and will involve a longer road trip.

Nonetheless, as a family we're excited and we can't wait.
