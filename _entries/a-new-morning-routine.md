For quite some time now, I've had this early morning routine that involves waking up somewhere within the 3 o'clock hour. I'd credit our firstborn with presenting me the first trial opportunities of this routine (anyone who has a newborn knows exactly what I mean).

A couple years later, I remember being up one morning after putting the baby back to bed. I had a ton of studying to do because at the time, I was back in school pursuing a new undergrad degree. Feeling unmotivated as ever, I recall Googling some set of keywords along the lines of _'greatest motivational speech'_, hoping to get a boost of inspiration.

That's when I found the famous talk by Eric Thomas, [Secret to Success, How Bad Do You Want It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4){:target="_blank"}.

This video changed my life. Not only did it change _my_ life, but I would say it was the catalyst for creating hope and discovering new opportunities for my family.

Since the first watch of that video, things have been different. Eric Thomas's message brought new light and meaning to my mornings. When the baby woke us up, I'd stay up to study. I was determined to get us out of that one-bedroom / half-living-room extension that we lived in. I was driven to give my family the life they deserved.

Here's a short list of what I've gone through since learning to leverage my morning routine:

- Graduated Magna Cum Laude with a BS in Information Technology
- Prepared for and ran my first 5K
- Discovered a new passion in web and software development
- Got accepted into (and graduated from) MakerSquare
- Moved my family to Austin
- Landed my first role in tech as an Associate Web Developer
- Transitioned into my second dev role at IBM as a Software Developer
- Bought a home
- Maintained a daily (workday) gym schedule
- Beat traffic and the Texas summer heat, at least for the mornings
- the list goes on ...



#### Starting Again
These days, my morning routine is pretty simple. I wake up at around 3:30 AM, if it's Monday I cut my hair so that I start the week with a fresh new cut, but for every other day, the routine follows the same pattern:

Wake up > shower > iron my shirt > gym > arrive at work before 7 AM

Earlier this week, I was driving into work and trying to figure out something to listen to on the way. I'll be honest, music is oftentimes the lowest on my list of audio choices these days. Most of my commute listening involves some sort of paranormal or conspiracy podcast, keeping up with the battle rap world, or an audiobook.

On this specific morning, I decided to listen to the latest Goalcast video. I found a really interesting video by Jim Kwik called [Morning Routine to Activate Your Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzFhcODWMxE){:target="_blank"}. In that, I learned a few things that I have already began, including:

- making my bed
- drinking a tall glass of water right away
- brushing my teeth with the opposite hand
- taking a cold shower (I've done this three times already)
- drinking tea
- journaling (this is why I'm here)

I will admit that on the first day of trying it, it felt amazing. Throughout the day, I kept revisiting this idea that 'I prepared, differently today'. For some reason, I was constantly mindful of it and it felt new. I felt... refreshed.

Yeah, I know, I'm a sucker for all things self-improvement. I am. But I'm looking forward to seeing how these new habits and rituals have an impact on my life over time. I'll definitely come back to this blog to share anything that I learn.

Good morning.
