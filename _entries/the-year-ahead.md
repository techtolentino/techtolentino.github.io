While I would normally not journal about these sorts of feelings and ideas until shortly after the new year, I think the timing is appropriate. Within the month of July, several anniversary-like events occur and a lot has been going through my head as of late.

<br>

#### Giving Thanks
I feel it's only right to start off with appreciation. This is something I do often, but it happens in phases or in unpredictable moments. Sometimes I'm giving thanks in my mornings at the gym and other times it happens during the last few turns of my commute into work, right before parking and heading into the office.

My goal is to set an intention and develop a new pratice that allows me to exercise gratitude more regularly.

##### Family
I'm truly blessed to have my own family. I have an amazing, beautiful wife who supports me and brings out the best of who I am. Together, we are blessed to have and belong to our two highly energetic, brilliant, hilarious, and loving boys. The amount of love we share, the unit that we are, and the culture we have within our family is indescribably fulfilling.

I'm thankful for my parents and siblings, who I'm able to communicate with often even though we don't connect enough. They continue to be there for us when we need them and I'm thankful that in all of the possibilities of life, timelines, and realities, that we ended up in this specific time and place, to share this journey.

##### Friends
I don't have a lot or perhaps the better way to phrase that is that I keep my 'inner-circle' small. Maybe (now that I think of it) I would actually consider these individuals as 'family', and they belong in an extension of the section above.

For the past week, we were fortunate to host two friends who were visiting from out-of-town and we had a wonderful time in doing so. While they're both originally my wife's friends from when she was growing up in San Diego, I consider them to be my own as well, mostly because we've grown close and have stayed connected throughout the years. I also know that they mean the world to her, they are her everything. Thank you to Rowena and Mikey for your visit, friendship, and the continuous laughs over the past week.

Bobby, I can't say enough about this dude. Since moving out to Austin, I have yet to meet a single individual that I could relate to more. I'm forever grateful for having him as a friend, who can listen to me, resonate with what I'm going through, and always push me to go for what's best.

##### Health
As a part of my morning routine, I hit the gym 5 days a week &mdash; I love it. My monthly membership at the Cedar Park Rec facility ends today, and I'm thinking of trying a new place that's open 24 hours. In fact, I've decided, I'm switching this weekend.

I look back at all the food choices that we make these days. A few years back, my wife made the decision to have our family eat primarily organic and I appreciate it. In addition, I've learned recently that I need to stay away from dairy and gluten, so the range of what I can eat and where I can eat has been upgraded to factor all of that in. Nonetheless, on this morning, I'm thankful for it (as I sip my organic detox tea).

##### Work
I'm thankful to be where I am &mdash; working in the tech industry, working in code, and using my skills to help people solve problems. Not only am I happy to be on this career path, I'm excited that I work in a field that is endlessly growing and interesting to me. Yes, I still wake up at 3:30 AM to learn new technologies and study.

For the past four and a half years, I've had great mentors and teammates that I've learned from. Where my career takes me in the next year, I'll leave that up to the universe, for only it knows the intentions that I've put out there.
