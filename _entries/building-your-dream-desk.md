#### A newfound past-time
Prior to purchasing our home, I became heavily interested in woodworking projects. For a week straight, when the fam was asleep, I'd binge watch videos on Youtube, fascinated by the amazing work that people were sharing -- things like custom coffee tables, farm tables, floating shelves, artwork, you name it. I told Khris that I when we moved into our home, I would buy a few tools and attempt to make some of the stuff I'd seen.

Over the last four months, I've slowly transformed a portion of our garage into a makeshift shop which has allowed me to become familiar with a very small set of tools. My normal routine of waking-up-at-4am-to-code has now been transferred over to this new practice.

I also feel like this is critical for the boys to witness because they understand that I knew nothing about building when we first moved in. I try to ensure that they see me running into mishaps, researching a solution, and solving a problem. Ultimately, I want them to see what interest + practice can equate to.

#### Inspiration & design
About six years back, we were sitting at my cousin Zar's dining table one night and I remember telling myself that 'I would love to have something like this in my home office someday.' Since then, I've always held onto this dream of having a large, expansive desk -- one that provided a sense of space and clarity.

When I decided to take on idea of building my own desk, it had to fit that requirement, it had to have room to _mentally breathe_. I was also inspired by a lot of the furniture design work by Mike Montgomery at [Modern Builds](http://www.modernbuilds.com/), along with the precision-based craftsmanship of Glenn from [DIY Creators](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChKlSK39lLg8eZHIX0iVzLA). Both of these guys are amazing at documenting their processes of building some really cool stuff.

After about a week of cycling through designs in my head, I chose to build a contemporary styled desk with the following specifics:

- dimensions: 60" w x 6" h x 30" d
- material: premium birch plywood
- desktop color: flat white
- detail: exposed plywood edges
- finish: glossed edges and satin top

#### The process
I orginally began ideating in Sketch, even though I know it's not the right tool to use for illustrations. It took about a week of iterating over different styles  before arriving at what I liked. The final design would be a boxed, rounded-corner desk top, with slots for optinal storage.

With the dimensions and design figured out, I began planning my cuts. After purchasing two 4 x 8 birch plywood boards, I outlined the cuts, and went to work with the circular saw. I made around 27 straight cuts with the circ saw (not easy), and prepared them for the glue up phase.

In my mind, there's something to appreciate about having the ability to make your own furniture or house decor. There's this _sense of pride_ one feels when a project actually turns out as expected.
